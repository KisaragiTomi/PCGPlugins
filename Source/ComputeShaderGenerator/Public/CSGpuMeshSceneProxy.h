/**
 * Base scene proxy that draws a GPU-resident mesh directly through the render
 * pipeline: it owns an FLocalVertexFactory over GPU buffers and submits one
 * FMeshBatch per view in GetDynamicMeshElements. Vertex/index data lives only on
 * the GPU — nothing is read back to the CPU (except an explicit, opt-in save) and
 * no UDynamicMesh is involved.
 *
 * The buffer set is DESCRIPTOR-DRIVEN. A subclass supplies geometry by implementing
 * two hooks:
 *   RegisterStreams()  — push FCSGpuStreamDesc entries (usually AddStandardTriangleStreams())
 *                        and set VertexCapacity/IndexCapacity.
 *   BuildGeometry()    — register the base's pooled buffers into an FRDGBuilder and run
 *                        the leaf's compute passes that fill them (incl. MeshCounters).
 * The base then owns everything shared by every GPU mesh (roads, the compute-shader mesh
 * generator, ...): buffer allocation, vertex-factory binding, the draw path, teardown,
 * and the CPU readback used by save-to-StaticMesh. Adding a new buffer is one more
 * AddStream(...) in RegisterStreams(); the alloc / VF-bind / readback code is untouched.
 *
 * Ray tracing: the base also owns a BLAS over the Position and Index streams, so hardware Lumen,
 * ray traced shadows and reflections see the mesh. It is built from the draw-args mirror the
 * resident set publishes (the only CPU copy of a GPU-decided triangle count) by an end-of-frame
 * pump, and rebuilt whenever a new readback lands. See RefreshRayTracingGeometry for the rules.
 *
 * Lumen surface cache: a BLAS alone only occludes. Hardware Lumen shades a ray hit by looking the
 * hit primitive up in its surface cache, and a primitive without mesh cards comes back black —
 * measured 2026-09-11, hits on GPU meshes returned no bounce at all. So the base also hands Lumen
 * a card set (six axis-aligned cards over the local bounds, the skeletal-mesh recipe) and one
 * card-capture batch per draw batch. See DrawStaticElements for why those are static batches that
 * nothing but the card capture ever draws.
